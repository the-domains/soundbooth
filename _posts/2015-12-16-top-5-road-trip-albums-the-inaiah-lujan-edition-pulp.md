description: "Ahh, the great American Road Trip; There's really nothing quite like it. The feel of the tires on the road, the beautiful sights and sounds of American all around; In my humble opine, America is best experienced at high rates of speed, coffee firmly in hand, looking through the wonder of this great nation through a bug-stained windshield."
